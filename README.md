# NAVIWire

NAVIWire application is a software which make 3D wiring during CTO PCI very easy

## When to Use?

In CTO PCI stiff wires like Gaia and Conquest usualy goes subintimaly. if you haphazourdly rotate the wire to reach the distal lumen then it can create a large subintimal space and often hematoma. main lumen collapse and distal entry become very difficult. this application will guide you to how to enter the distal lumen with controlled rotation.

## How to use

if you goes subintimal, first take an RAO 45 degree view and siftware will ask you the location of wire shaft and tip orietnation. after giving this information, rotate your machine 90 degree towards LAO (i.e LAO 45) and again input these information. the software will output instructuction to how to redirect your wire. the software will also output the virtual IVUS with orientation of wire and location of shaft.
